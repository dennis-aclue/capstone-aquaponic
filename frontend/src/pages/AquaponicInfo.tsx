                <p>What is aquaponics?</p>
                Some contend that aquaponics is the future of food production. It is a sustainable way to grow food that
                combines aquaculture (raising aquatic animals such as fish, crayfish, prawns or snails) with hydroponics
                (cultivating plants in water) in a symbiotic environment. The waste produced by the animals (fish,
                shrimp,
                etc.) provides a natural fertilizer for the plants, while the plants clean the water for the animals.

                <p>What is aquaponics good for?</p>
                Aquaponics is a sustainable way to grow food. It is a closed loop system that recycles water and
                nutrients
                and produces no waste. It is a great way to grow food in a small space, and it can be done indoors or
                outdoors. It is a great way to grow food in a small space, and it can be done indoors or outdoors.
